							CUSCO 丨An Inca Poet In The Andes With His Dear Charango
							
							
						</h2>
						<p>
							Andes, the longest continental mountain range in the world, cultivated various tribes in South America. Not majestic like Himalayas, Andes mountains are more amiable and pristine. </p>

<p>Inca Empire showed its notable power in history preceding Christopher Columbus's voyages of 1492. The capital Cusco witnessed how it went to annihilation. Wait… or shall I say rebirth? Listen, the music of Charango flies among valleys. That’s an omen, the poem of Andes goes into the new chapter.

				<h2>
						Close to divinity, returning to innocence
				</h2>
				
				<p>The medium-size plane landed at the airport on plateau, what came in our view firstly were countless bungalows composed from local scarlet bricks, which were sparkling in reddish light subtly under the blazing sunshine. I couldn’t imagine this was in July, the winter period in South America. I wore a thin T-shirt with short sleeve and felt well until I walked out of the gate. I started to get in touch with its feature, the chilling breeze disillusioned me of all the imagination about sunny days. It was sunlit, true… and it was freaking cold.</p>

<p>The taxi drove us to the local inn we ordered, with the fresh wind passed by my face, I couldn’t stop to imagine what would take place in following days.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/222.png" alt=""/></p>

<p>After a sweet nap, we started to lose ourselves in the small but historical town. Since our inn was situated on the hillside with a dominant view, we went downhill along to the Plaza de Armas. Some local residents with typical Peruvian customs said Hello in various Asian languages trying to show their hospitalities. Mainly they said “Konnichiwa” (こんにちは) and I replied “¡Hola!”, I guess we are quite alien for them and Japanese tourists must be the major part in the Asian visitors. They told me they know this merely from Japanese cartoons.</p>

<p>We found a pub to settle down our lunch. Even we got into the so-called highest Irish-owned pub in the world, the food was quite nice. Paddy’s provided us with a place to enjoy the mixed-style gourmet (Peruvian and Western meal): the ingredients were all from Peru originally while the process was in Irish style. Natural and advanced, it felt like the I was in a concert with Celtic and Inca singers, they both try the best to compose a magnificent duet with echoing tone for tone. </p>

<p>Main course finished, we decided to leave to find the local food on streets. Don’t you think the ordinary booths or kiosks by the street are always surprising the tourist with the original cuisine and tastes? </p>

<p>Exactly, I found my favourite snack, La Causa. Generally, it is defined as a side dish. In the original birthplace for potato, the Peruvian optimised the cooking skills making it in a variety of potato cuisine. Mashed potato in high-saturation yellow, grounded yellow chile and a little bit lemon juice perfect this elite Peruvian dish. La causa has a velvety texture in mouthfeel. It is a gift grasping foodie’s tongue with detonating a gourmet bomb. Sometimes, the chief puts a few bacon bits on La causa, which enrich the tasting experience positively.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/IMG_0090.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>Suddenly, music surrounding us was up, it was from the Plaza de Armas. With the noises of towing, we found there would be a concert here. It was a Sunday, and luckily, it was Festival Claro preparing. </p>

<p>Watching the traditional Peruvian dancing parade, we wandered through the mud walls in the old town, local vendors yelling for sales were standing alongside alleys. They all showed the hand-made products in various kinds. Some are selling fresh orange juice with her little child assisting in peeling and some made outfits with the wool from alpaca. It made me feel something was the tourism had brought to them. Cusco’s myth established a tour site and boosted local commerce. Residents living in mountains had a chance to advance the rural economy into a more diversified phase. Thinking, gaining and experiencing enlivened the travel… Some distant noises came to us from the top of the hill, where the Cristo Blanco stands. </p>

<p><img src="assets/images/IMG_0095.JPG" alt=""/></p>
<p><img src="assets/images/IMG_4763 copy.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>We stepped upwards along the steep stone slope, there was a fair every weekend on the hilltop. All local alien gourmets were displayed for sale. I could not recall their names but they are 100% from Peruvian table, and I could tell some similarities in Chinese cuisine. Including choices of spice and controlling the consistence of soup, where I believe the Amerindian relates very closely to the Chinese, those fair foods brought me into the ancient Andes to see how the Amerindian grew crops and made the local cuisine. They met my tastes totally.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/111.png" alt=""/></p>

<p>The dinner was finished perfectly and the festival was going to start. The sun had set, and dusk settled over the old town. I held my camera standing on a observation deck trying to record the amazing view. One local drinking his own wine brewed by himself with his friends and he noticed me. He greeted to me and I was invited to have some wine as well. It was not the commercial taste, instead, it was silky and natural, more like a mixture of syrup, spirit and some herbal concentration. “Super refreshing!” I praised. We spend a good time in chatting. Talking about of everything in China and Peru, the plaza was gathered more and more people. “Here the festival starts, let’s go.” he said.</p>

<p>Around hundreds of locals and tourists were dancing to the music from the band. I couldn’t follow it a little bit because I didn’t know much about Spanish. The only thing I could do was dancing with humming. And suddenly all the people just repeated the same melody “Aya yayayaya yayayayaya ayayaya yayaya…”. It was Gian Marco singing “Te Mentiria”, the local friend told me. I must say it was amazing to dance with an exotic music in the center of Cusco plaza, under the winter moonlight, with a bunch of new friends, and the alcohol. </p>

<p><img src="assets/images/IMG_5605-2.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>We said farewell once the concert over. I was back to the inn and had a sleep which could not be more sweet. The cozy and huge quilt made from wool of alpaca protected me in the cradle of Andes. My dream drifted away and tomorrow was coming. </p>

<p>The second day’s plan is to climb Machu Picchu. We ordered the train tickets to Aguas Calientes firstly. In over 4-hour railway tour, I was shocked by the scenery on both sides: indigo sky and gorgeous mountain under the strong sunshine, the bush and scrub were shining. Occasionally the train drove into specular curves, the snow on the mountains top was appearing as like the mount was playing hide-and-seek with me. It was clear to see considerable adventurers trekking by the Inca Trail, which I should do as well if my time permitted. </p>
<p><img src="assets/images/IMG_5715 copy.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>
<img src="assets/images/IMG_6772 copy.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>Reading is always a good option to kill time. I bought the book " Lost City of the Incas" by explorer Hiram Bingham in Cusco previously. With getting more about the story of Machu Picchu and its builders, my memories came back to the moment I watched “Indiana Jones” first time. Exciting and inspiring, we got the destination finally. </p>

<p>Aguas Calientes, the hot spring town, is situated in the foot of a group of mountains along by the Urubamba River. Here the urban impression faded out. Raising head looking up to the sky, it was found that how human-beings humble in the center of natural majesties. Unfortunately, we only booked the one-way bus to Machu Picchu just due to the cash was almost running out. But it was not a tragedy, I always prefer not to go on the same way twice since I could find new sceneries on another road. A new perspective? Who knows. </p>

<p><img src="assets/images/IMG_6000 copy.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>The tickets of Machu Picchu and Mountain were booked 1 month before, but the one to Huayna Picchu was completely sold out even 40 days before during the high season. </p>

<p>We took a rest and got up early on 4 a.m. just to take the bus. It was always cloudy and foggy in the morning, I started worried if we could see the Old Inca City or not. But my anguish was eliminated with sky clearing up gradually. </p>

<p>On the high sea level plateau, everyone except us equipped professionally with mountaineering clothes. My friend, wearing a normal sandal, and I, in an ordinary T-shirt and a thin coat. It was freezing indeed and it was urging us continue walking and walking. We climbed through the Incan ruins and started to ascend to the mountain. Zigzags led us to the unique atmosphere: a world of dews and fresh air, we totally were back to the ancient Andes valley hearing the old Charango far away.  </p>

<p>We arrived at the top of mountain in 1 hour nearly, the Urubamba River was underneath our feet. And Huayna Picchu was showing its magic appearance in the lucid sky. Under the Tyndall effect, some beams were shining out like arrows. “The Inca myth has been revived” I thought. </p>

<p><img src="assets/images/IMG_0087.JPG" alt=""/></p>
<p><img src="assets/images/IMG_0088.JPG" alt=""/></p>

<p>After enjoying the banquet of mysterious nature, we started to walk back to the town. From Machu Picchu to Aguas Calientes, it was a sacred and undeveloped short trip that took around 3 or 4 hours on walking. Hiking on the paths where Hiram explored, I felt like I was talking to him. As a guide in Inca myths, he invited us to this wonderland to feel, to immerse ourselves into the amazing aura. Forgetting all the daily worries and trivial matters, it brought the primitive world back to the truth. </p>  

<p>Tired and exhausted, we finally caught up the train to Cusco. In the night we had the alpaca tenderloin in the local restaurant. It was served with 3 kinds of dips: one crystal salt for seasoning and two grounded peppers sauce (green and red). Compared with my imagination before, the alpaca tenderloin was chewy and tough. It was not gamey I must say, I believe it was credit to the cook’s. </p>

<p>We bought the red-eye bus drive to next city due to the limited budget. Since we gave up the normal choice of tourist, we were on the bus full of locals except us. It was double-deck, and we picked the first row to see scenery passing by. With the only thin coat and T-shirt, it was freaking cold in the night. We both could not fall in sleep, somehow I looked up to the sky, the super clear and twinkling stars I never seen in city appeared. I stared at them and they winked to me. </p>

<p>During the trip, the book "Wan Shui Qian Shan Zou Bian" by Sanmao accompanied me all the way. She wrote down the experience in the South America as a pioneer of cultural exploration. She stated that she must be an Indian in her past life. I have no idea about that do we really have a past life or saṃsāra, but it is quite nice to have the faith in the journey. From this perspective, our journey is not aimless anymore, instead, we start finding ourselves in the whole process and it is getting to be cherished. </p>

<p><img src="assets/images/333.png" alt=""/></p>

<p>Neruda praised Andes occasionally in his works, which could prove the importance of this holy mountain:</p>
<p class="text-left"><em style="font-size: 16px; text-align: center; font-style: italic; line-height: 22px; color: #666666;">“Homeland, the earth placed<br>
  on your slim hands<br>
  its toughest banner,<br>
  the Andean Cordillera,<br>
  snowed blade, pristine solitudes,<br>
  stone and shiver,<br>
  and on your side<br>
  like an infinite flower the sea offers you<br>
  its spilt foam.”<br>
</em></p>

<p>from his fiction "Ode to the Andean Cordillera" translated by Ilan Stavans.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/IMG_6081.jpg" alt=""/></p>

<p>True, when you stepped onto the land feeling the overwhelming pristine solitude, what could the infinite flower be? Twinkling stars over your head? The breeze coming through the South Pacific up to Andes? Or the original smiles on Peruvians’ faces telling the Inca myths? They are, and your imagination about passion towards all the fantasy is as well.
